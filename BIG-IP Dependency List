The f5_copy_virtual script understands and attempts to gather the following dependencies for each BIG-IP Local Traffic Manager Virtual Server:

Default Pool
  Healh Monitor(s)
  Members
    Health Monitor(s) - Member Specific
SNAT Pools
iRules
  Datagroup Usage (using text search)
  iFile
  Pools Referenced via iRule "pool" command
Profiles (handled generically with specific code for following:
  (Profile Inheritance/Parent Profiles)
  Client-SSL
    Cert
    Key
    ChainCert
    Cipher Group
    Cipher Rules
    Passphrase Detection (user prompted when profile with passphrase is POSTd)   
Persistence Profiles
  Universal Persistence (special)
    iRule used by Universal Persistence Profile
Policies
  Policy Rules
    Policy Actions
      Pools Referenced in Policy Actions
Policy Strategies (exotic configuration element that is rarely customized)
ASM Security Policy
Security Logging Profile

Dependencies not yet addressed:
BIG-IP APM Configurations
BIG-IP AFM Configurations
Non-default pools referenced in Local Traffic Policies
HTML Profiles (need to implement iterating through the rules and grabbing them)
Investigate custom server-ssl scenarios and how much of the code for client-ssl can be re-used (probably much)
HSL profiles
Eviction Policies
External Datagroups (usage of external datagroups [datagroups generally] is detected in iRules, but external datagroup file isn't currently copied)
iRule re-selections of alternative clientssl/serverssl profiles, or any other type of profile than be overriden in iRule
