The f5_copy_virtual script understands and attempts to gather the following dependencies for each BIG-IP Local Traffic Manager Virtual Server:

Default Pool
  Healh Monitor(s)
  Members
    Health Monitor(s) - Member Specific
SNAT Pools
iRules
  Datagroup Usage (using text search)
  iFile
Profiles (handled generically with specific code for following:
  (Profile Inheritance/Parent Profiles)
  Client-SSL
    Cert
    Key
    ChainCert
    Cipher Group
    Cipher Rules
    Passphrase Detection (user prompted when profile with passphrase is POSTd)   
Persistence Profiles
Policies
  Policy Rules
    Policy Actions

ASM Security Policy
Security Logging Profile

Dependencies not yet addressed:
BIG-IP APM Configurations
BIG-IP AFM Configurations
HTML Profiles (need to implement iterating through the rules and grabbing them)
Investigate custom server-ssl scenarios and how much of the code for client-ssl can be re-used (probably much)
HSL profiles
Eviction Policies
